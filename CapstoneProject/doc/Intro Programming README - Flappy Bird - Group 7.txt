Flappy Bird Game
Authors: Kevin Lee, Michelle Chen, Quang Le
Revision: May 05, 2022


Introduction: 


     Flappy Bird is a game in which a player controls an animal to move between columns without hitting them or falling down. This new version of Flappy Bird implements enhanced abilities and new obstacles. The player receives a point (or a coin), which can later be used for opening new abilities, for each successful pass through a pair of columns. Anyone who wants to play a simple and quick game may enjoy Flappy Bird. The goal of this game is to solve the problem of boredom. [a]


Instructions:


     Make the bird fly up by pressing on the spacebar such that the bird can fly through the pipes. Use J, K, L for decreasing the character’s speed, widening the gap between columns, or becoming invulnerable for a few seconds. 
[optional feature - level 2: collecting coins, decreasing speed, making the gap between columns bigger for an interval of time, becoming invulnerable for an interval of time, including new obstacles, etc.]

Credits:
[Gives credit for project components. This includes both internal credit (your group members) and external credit (other people, websites, libraries). To do this:
* List the group members and describe how each member contributed to the completion of the final program. This could be classes written, art assets created, leadership/organizational skills exercises, or other tasks. Initially, this is how you plan on splitting the work.
* Give credit to all outside resources used. This includes downloaded images or sounds, external java libraries, parent/tutor/student coding help, etc.]

[a]I think we need to brainstorm ways to make your program more unique. In what way will your program be different from the existing FlappyBird game?
